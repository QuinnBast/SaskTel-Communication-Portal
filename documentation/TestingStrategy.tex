%	Introduction
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\section{Introduction}
\paragraph{}
	This document outlines and defines the Testing plan and libraries utilized to provide a stable, maintainable solution. The initial problem statement and proposed activities are suggestions given by Sasktel to provide a manageable scope. To provide a refresh on the intent of the project, the problem statement has been provided in the following paragraphs. The decisions on infrastructure, aside from the Broadworks API and telephone account access are left up to us to decide. 
\subsection{Problem Statement}
\paragraph{} 
	SaskTel requires a communications portal that can interwork with a Telephony Application Server and our core network to present communications and feature capabilities through a browser.  This will allow for the exploration of new communications service models. 
\paragraph{} 
	SaskTel has been pursuing the deployment of a new communications core along with the Cisco/Broadsoft Telephony Application Server branded as Broadworks.  One of the drivers is to enable a richer customer experience through a converged architecture that exposes rapid development to enables new capabilities.  Broadworks exposes the Application Programming Interface to access service control tools and user information.  These tools and information can be used to create new communications applications or add additional value to existing applications.  
\paragraph{} 
	The main objectives for SaskTel is to gain exposure to new and innovative communications service experience for our customers and to promote the potential internally for aligning resources, time and effort in enabling applications.

\section{Automated testing}
\paragraph{}	Testing is important for the project, and as such it needs to be done continuously. Plenty of tools exist to provide the frameworks and tools to create easily executed test frameworks. Namely there are tools that provide continuous integration testing, unit testing, and user experience testing. 

\subsubsection{TravisCI (In Use)}
\paragraph{}	TravisCI, completely referred to as Travis Continuous Integration is a cloud based testing service. It is Configured using a Yaml file to provide a configured Linux environment and run specified tests upon any merge request into the Master branch of the Github project. It provides a report, and if any tests fail it discourages the merge. There are alternatives such as CircleCI and Jenkins, but due to it's ease of use compared to Jenkins, and existing longer than CircleCI it was chosen for this project. The following figure demonstrates a passing test case, providing information on the build and test.\\

	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{TravisCI.png}
	\caption{TravisCI Passing Build}
	\end{figure}
	\newpage

\subsubsection{Mocha (In Use)}
\paragraph{}	Mocha is a robust test bench, which provides a harness for running unit tests within.
\subsubsection{Jest (Not In Use)}

\subsubsection{Chai (In Use)}

\section{User Stories}
\paragraph{}	The following sections denote common use cases for the program that we brainstormed and consider to be requirements by usability and basic principle. The basic structure for user stories is as follows. "As a <type of user> I would like to < be able to do task> so that I can < metric improvement to life>". User stories are referenced by the number following the chapter value, which means user story 1 will refer to sub-section x.1.

\paragraph{}	User stories are important for test development as they provide ground work for the requirements and functionalities that tests should be sure to incorporate and provide solutions for. The following user stories are utilized to provide a feature driven development approach to the project, while keeping quantifiable, and testable data present to be monitored during development. 

\subsection{Log In}
\paragraph{}	As a \textit{SaskTel Customer}, I would like to be able to \textit{Log into the program} so that I can \textit{use the program and check my information}.

\subsection{Log Out}
\paragraph{}	As a \textit{SaskTel Customer}, I would like to be able to \textit{Log out of the program} so that I can \textit{ensure that anyone using my computer can't access my account}.

\subsection{Check Call Logs}
\paragraph{}	As a \textit{SaskTel Customer}, I would like to be able to \textit{check my call logs} so that I can \textit{check when I got calls, and see who called me/when}.

\subsection{Turn on Call Forwarding Always}
\paragraph{}	As a \textit{SaskTel Customer}, I would like to be able to \textit{always forward calls sent to my phone} so that I can \textit{answer them on my main phone and not worry about my secondary phone}.

\subsection{Turn on Call Forwarding Busy}
\paragraph{}	As a \textit{SaskTel Customer}, I would like to be able to \textit{forward calls when my phone is busy} so that I can \textit{feel comfortable that those calling me get sent to someone who can answer}.

\subsection{Turn on Call Forwarding Selective}
\paragraph{}	As a \textit{SaskTel Customer}, I would like to be able to \textit{forward phone calls to another phone during a scheduled time} so that I can \textit{so that phone calls can be forwarded when I have planned events in the way of answering my phone}.

\subsection{Turn on Call Forwarding No Answer}
\paragraph{}	As a \textit{SaskTel Customer}, I would like to be able to \textit{forward calls when I'm away from my phone} so that I can \textit{answer them on my cell phone when I'm away from my land line}.

\subsection{Turn on Call Forwarding}
\paragraph{}	As a \textit{SaskTel Customer}, I would like to be able to \textit{forward phone calls to another number} so that I can \textit{be sure that important calls reach me on my cell phone or work phone}.

\subsection{Turn on Do Not Disturb}
\paragraph{}	As a \textit{SaskTel Customer}, I would like to be able to \textit{decline all calls to my phone number} so that I can \textit{have some time without worrying about phone calls interrupting me}.

\subsection{View my Profile}
\paragraph{}	As a \textit{SaskTel Customer}, I would like to be able to \textit{view my account information} so that I can \textit{know that I am using the right account}.

\subsection{Call a Phone Number}
\paragraph{}	As a \textit{SaskTel Customer}, I would like to be able to \textit{call a phone number from my computer} so that I can \textit{easily make phone calls without using my phone}.

\subsection{Start a Call to a Phone Number from my Phone}
\paragraph{}	As a \textit{SaskTel Customer}, I would like to be able to \textit{call another phone number from my phone} so that I can \textit{more easily call phone numbers I find on my computer}.

\subsection{View Feature Access Codes}
\paragraph{}	As a \textit{SaskTel Customer}, I would like to be able to \textit{check what star codes I can use} so that I can \textit{understand what I can do with my phone when I can't log into the application}.

\newpage
\section{Tests}
\paragraph{}	As test cases are created, and audited to be successful test cases they're documented in this section. In order to have a record trail of the tested features and tests that are required, during the test development phase of our project, the following sections will begin to be fleshed out in further detail.

\subsection{Unit}
\paragraph{}	This section consists of all test cases that test JavaScript functions and classes.

\subsection{User Experience} 
\paragraph{}	This section consists of all test cases that tests the complete website against simulated user scenarios and tests expected behaviours.

\subsection{Component}
\paragraph{}	This section consists of all test cases that test React Components state rendering and life-cycle correctness.
