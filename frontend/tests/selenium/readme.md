# Selenium

### Integration testing

Selenium tests are used to test all of the individual units together inside of the web browser.
Because of this, the selenium tests are sensitive to changes in the User Inferface, however, they are able to
test functionality within a web browser such as cookie storage, form interactions, and more.
