# Postman

### REST API testing

Postman's CLI interface "Newman" allows Postman collactions to be exported and run together.
The files in this directory are exported directly from postman.

Note: Ensure the postman environment does not include usernames and passwords upon exporting.
Travis-CI can setup usernames and passwords in the environment configuration.
